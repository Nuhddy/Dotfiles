# Dotfiles

Multi-host flake with configurations for NixOS, NixOS on WSL, and Windows

## Todo

- Extend lib instead of importing on use
- Convenient sync of Windows dotfiles with backups for overwritten files
- Custom variables for per-host configuration (screen res, etc.)
- Port iso-config to flake-parts
- Refer to files as a path relative to the flake-root instead of path relative to individual module files
